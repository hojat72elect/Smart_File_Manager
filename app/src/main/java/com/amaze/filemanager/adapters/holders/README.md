This directory contains all the `ViewHolder`s we'll be using in different RecyclerViews of our app.
Later on, I will convert these ViewHolders to Composable functions, and a `ComposeView` will wrap
and expose those composable to their respective RecyclerViews.
This way, it'll be easier to gradually migrate this codebase to Jetpack Compose.
